# SpaceInvader
The goal of this project is in transitioning from java programming to python programming. Using the ideas I have learnt throughout my java journey and pivot over it onto python. 
# Alpha Version
A very bare bone based Space Invader, with enemies spawning on the screen as well as you being able to shoot them of course.
# 2.0 
Added both enemy variety based on color as well as upgrades for the player come round 6.
# 3.0(WIP)
Planned things to add:
 1. Boss wave with unique AI that would challenge the player every 5-10 waves, preferablely before each upgrade.
 2. Add more unique upgrades that would make the game play feel unique each time.
 3. To be continued.
